# What is Examination System?

* Nowadays, Computerized systems have been increasing in education. Information Technology plays a very crucial role in education. Computers have made a dramatic change in the learning system. The information enables education institutions to save space and time and allows the delivery of education services quickly, anywhere, and anytime. For instance, physical libraries are replaced by online libraries available to anyone; anywhere in the world, students can interact with lecturers online, whether live or via video. With computer software, we can be able to have access to vast databases of information. Information technology makes the exchanges of data fast and easy.

* Information technology provides systems that allow students to perform many tasks automatically and not manually. Students can take the exam using a computerized system; they don’t need a paper-based exam. They save time and money when using a computer system in their studies.

# Research Methodology 

* Main methodology activities held during the research are acquiring information and knowledge about the online examination system by reading books and research done in a related area and obtained all the research materials over the internet, Wikipedia, and other websites. The next step taken is reading, comprehending, and analyzing literature review and matching information obtained. This research emphasizes an online examination system, which includes usability, user-friendly interface, reliability of the needs of target users. 

The different stages for this Project Activity: 
1. **Project Planning:** Planning will take the details planning for the timing of the working progress and types of technique next. Planning also concerns that the methodology that will be going to use for this project.
2. **Requirements  Analysis:** It is to build a logical model of this system. In this phase, what kind of data requirement and the functional need will decide. 
3. **Design:** For this project, the design will create using the Java Net beans.
4. **Tools:**  The tools required to develop the system are Net Beans IDE 8.2 version and any MySQL platform.
5. **Testing:** This phase will evaluate or verify the system that was developed. This phase will have a secured database to simulate the system’s genuine database.
